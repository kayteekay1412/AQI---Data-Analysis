# Air Quality Index Data Analysis Project

This is a data analysis project that focuses on the topic of air quality index (AQI). The project explores AQI data for Delhi and provides insights and visualizations related to various aspects of air quality.

## Project Overview

The project consists of Python code that uses the pandas library for data manipulation and the Plotly library for data visualization. It performs the following tasks:

1. Data Loading: Loads AQI data from a CSV file, which contains information about different pollutants over time.

2. Time Series Analysis: Generates time series plots for each air pollutant to visualize their concentration trends over time.

3. AQI Calculation: Calculates the AQI for each row of data by considering the concentrations of different pollutants. It categorizes the AQI values into predefined categories.

4. AQI Visualization: Creates visualizations to show the AQI trends over time, including a time series plot and a histogram.

5. Pollutant Concentrations: Calculates the total concentrations of various pollutants and displays them in a donut plot.

6. Hourly Trends in AQI: Analyzes and visualizes the hourly average AQI trends.

7. Average AQI by Day of the Week: Calculates and visualizes the average AQI for each day of the week.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is loaded from the "delhiaqi (2).csv" file, which should be placed in the specified location. Make sure to replace this file with your own dataset if needed.

## Usage

To run the code, make sure you have the required libraries (pandas, plotly) installed. You can run the code in your Python environment. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
